### Installation
You can use HACS or install the component manually:

To get started put the files from `/custom_components/braviatv_psk/` in your folder `<config directory>/custom_components/braviatv_psk/`

### Configuration
#### Example configuration.yaml

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: braviatv_psk
    host: 192.168.1.101
    psk: sony
    mac: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
    amp: True
    android: True
    sourcefilter:
      - ' HD'
      - HDMI
    time_format: 12H
    user_labels: True
    name: MyBraviaTV
```

### Configuration variables

key | required | value | description  
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
**platform** | yes | `braviatv_psk` | The platform name `braviatv_psk`.
**host** | yes | `192.168.1.101` | The IP of the Sony Bravia TV, eg. 192.168.1.101.
**psk** | yes | `sony` | The Pre-Shared Key of the Sony Bravia TV, eg. sony (see below for instructions how to configure this on the TV). Place the psk between quotes if you use digits and those start with one or more zero's, e.g. '0044'.
**mac** | no | `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` | The MAC address of the Sony Bravia TV (see below for instructions how to get this from the TV). This is used to turn on the TV using WakeOn LAN and is only needed if the TV is non-Android.
**amp** | no | `False` | Boolean, defaults to False. Set this to True if you have an amplifier attached to the TV and not use the internal TV speakers. Then the volume slider will not be shown as this doesn’t work for the amplifier. Mute and volume up and down buttons are there and working with an amplifier.
**android** | no | `False` |"Boolean, defaults to False. Set this to True when you have an Android TV as these TV’s don’t respond to WakeOn LAN commands, so another method of turning on the TV can be used. Also a service to open apps is added to Home Assistant.
**sourcefilter** | no | `HD` | List of text that is used to filter the source list, eg. ’ HD’ (with quotes) will only show TV channels in the source list which contain ‘HD’, eg. ‘NPO 3 HD’ (in my config this will only show HD channels).
**time_format** | no | `24H` | Time format to use for program information. Valid options are `12H` or `24H`, default is `24H`.
**user_labels** | no | `True` | Use the user defined labels from the TV (where configured), instead of default port labels. If you have given e.g. the HDMI2 port on your TV a label, that will be shown.
**name** | no | `Sony Bravia TV` | The name the TV will have in Home Assistant, default is `Sony Bravia TV`.

#### braviatv_psk.bravia_open_app

You can use the following command to get all uri's from the TV:

```
Change `[psk]` with your psk and `[IP]` with the IP address of the TV.
